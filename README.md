## 1. Pixels

### 1.1 Definition
A **pixel** (short for picture element) is the smallest unit of a digital image or graphic that can be displayed and represented on a digital display device. In color images, each pixel typically contains multiple color components (e.g., Red, Green, and Blue in the RGB color space), allowing for the representation of a wide range of colors.

### 1.2 Mathematical Representation
An image can be represented as a 2D matrix or array of pixel intensity values. For a **grayscale image**, the intensity at each pixel location \((i, j)\) is a single scalar value:

\[
I(i,j) = \text{intensity value at pixel (i, j)}
\]

For a **color image** in the RGB color space, the image is represented by three matrices corresponding to the Red, Green, and Blue channels:

\[
I_{RGB}(i,j) = \left[ I_R(i,j), I_G(i,j), I_B(i,j) \right]
\]

Where \(I_R\), \(I_G\), and \(I_B\) are the intensity values for the respective color channels.

### 1.3 Example
- **Grayscale Image Example**: A pixel intensity value ranges from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
- **Color Image Example (RGB)**:
  - Red channel: \(I_R(i,j)\)
  - Green channel: \(I_G(i,j)\)
  - Blue channel: \(I_B(i,j)\)

---

## 2. Color Spaces

### 2.1 RGB Color Space
The **RGB color space** is an additive color model where colors are created by combining Red, Green, and Blue light in various intensities. This color space is widely used in digital imaging devices like cameras and displays.

#### 2.1.1 Representation
Each pixel's color is represented by a 3D vector \([R, G, B]\), where \(R\), \(G\), and \(B\) represent the intensity values for the Red, Green, and Blue channels, respectively.

#### 2.1.2 Example
Consider a pixel with the following RGB values: \([100, 150, 200]\), where:
- The red component is moderate.
- The green component is high.
- The blue component is medium.

This will result in a specific shade of color.

### 2.2 HSV Color Space
The **HSV** (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space represents colors using three components:
- **Hue (H)**: Represents the color type, ranging from 0° to 360°.
- **Saturation (S)**: Represents the vibrancy of the color, ranging from 0 to 1.
- **Value (V)**: Represents the brightness of the color, ranging from 0 to 1.

HSV is particularly useful for tasks where color descriptions align more closely with human perception.

#### 2.2.1 Conversion from RGB to HSV
To convert an RGB pixel to HSV:
1. Normalize the RGB values to [0, 1].
2. Compute the maximum and minimum values among \(R\), \(G\), and \(B\).
3. Compute the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
4. Compute the Hue, Saturation, and Value based on these computed values.

#### 2.2.2 Example
Example RGB to HSV conversion for a pixel:
- **RGB**: \([100, 150, 200]\)
- **Normalized RGB**: \([0.39, 0.59, 0.78]\)

---

## 3. Image Normalization

### 3.1 Min-Max Normalization
**Min-Max Normalization** scales pixel values to a fixed range, usually [0, 1].

#### 3.1.1 Mathematical Formula
Given an original pixel value \(p\), the normalized pixel value is:

\[
p' = \frac{p - p_{\text{min}}}{p_{\text{max}} - p_{\text{min}}}
\]

Where \(p_{\text{min}}\) and \(p_{\text{max}}\) are the minimum and maximum pixel intensity values in the image.

#### 3.1.2 Example
Normalize an image with pixel values ranging from 50 to 200 to the range [0, 1]:

\[
\text{Normalized Pixel} = \frac{125 - 50}{200 - 50} = 0.5
\]

---

## 4. Data Augmentation

Data augmentation increases the diversity of the dataset by applying transformations such as flipping, rotation, and cropping to existing data. This improves model robustness.

### 4.1 Flipping
Flipping involves mirroring the image along a specified axis.

#### 4.1.1 Horizontal Flip
For a pixel at coordinates \((i, j)\) in an image of width \(w\):

\[
i' = w - i
\]

#### 4.1.2 Vertical Flip
For a pixel at coordinates \((i, j)\) in an image of height \(h\):

\[
j' = h - j
\]

### 4.2 Rotation
Rotating an image by an angle \(\theta\) around its center involves the following transformation for pixel coordinates:

\[
\text{New coordinates} = \left[ x \cos(\theta) - y \sin(\theta), x \sin(\theta) + y \cos(\theta) \right]
\]

### 4.3 Cropping
Cropping extracts a specific region of interest (ROI) from the image, defined by its top-left coordinates and width and height.

---

## 5. Convolution and Filtering

### 5.1 Convolution Operation
Convolution is used to apply filters to an image. The convolution of an image with a kernel is defined as:

\[
I_{\text{out}}(i,j) = \sum_{m} \sum_{n} I_{\text{in}}(i+m,j+n) K(m,n)
\]

Where \(I_{\text{in}}\) is the input image and \(K\) is the kernel.

#### 5.1.1 Properties of Convolution
- **Linearity**
- **Commutativity**
- **Associativity**
- **Distributivity**

---

## 6. Essential Preprocessing Techniques

### 6.1 Resizing
Resizing ensures that all images have the same dimensions for model input.

#### 6.1.1 Mathematical Representation
Given an image of size \(W \times H\) and a desired size \(w' \times h'\), the scaling factors are \( \frac{w'}{W} \) and \( \frac{h'}{H} \).

---

## 7. Advanced Techniques

### 7.1 Fourier Transform
The Fourier Transform decomposes an image into its sinusoidal components, analyzing the frequency content.

#### 7.1.1 Mathematical Definition
The 2D Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an image is defined as:

\[
F(u,v) = \sum_{x} \sum_{y} f(x,y) \cdot \exp \left( -2\pi i \left( \frac{ux}{N_x} + \frac{vy}{N_y} \right) \right)
\]

### 7.2 Wavelet Transform
The Wavelet Transform provides a time-frequency representation, useful for analyzing non-stationary signals.

---

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step to make the images suitable for feeding into the deep learning model. The following steps are implemented:

### 1. **Resizing**:
   We resize all images to a fixed size to ensure they have the same dimensions (e.g., 224x224 pixels), which is the required input size for most CNN models.
   
   ```python
   import cv2
   import numpy as np

   def resize_image(image_path, target_size=(224, 224)):
       img = cv2.imread(image_path)
       img_resized = cv2.resize(img, target_size)
       return img_resized
   ```

### 2. **Normalization**:
   Pixel values are normalized to a range of [0, 1] to speed up model convergence.
   
   ```python
   def normalize_image(image):
       return image / 255.0
   ```

### 3. **Color Space Conversion (RGB to HSV)**:
   We convert images from RGB to HSV to enhance the color features.
   
   ```python
   def convert_to_hsv(image):
       return cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
   ```

---

## Data Augmentation

Data augmentation helps to artificially increase the dataset size and diversity by applying random transformations to the images.

### Augmentation Techniques:
- **Rotation**
- **Translation (shifting)**
- **Flipping**
- **Zooming**

```python
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=40,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)

def augment_image(image):
    image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)
    augmented_image = datagen.flow(image, batch_size=1)
    return augmented_image
```

---

## Image Filtering

Image filtering is used to emphasize certain features in the image and reduce noise.

### 1. **Edge Detection (Sobel Operator)**:
   This filter highlights the edges of objects within the image.

```python
def sobel_edge_detection(image):
    sobel_x = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3)
    sobel_y = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=3)
    edges = cv2.magnitude(sobel_x, sobel_y)
    return edges
```

### 2. **Gaussian Blur**:
   This filter is used to reduce image noise and detail by blurring the image.

```python
def apply_gaussian_blur(image):
    return cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (5, 5), 0)
```

---

## Model Training

### 1. **Pre-trained Model (VGG16)**:
   We use VGG16, a pre-trained model, and fine-tune it for the specific task.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

model = Sequential()
model.add(base_model)
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))  # Change to the number of classes

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### 2. **Model Training**:

```python
model.fit(train_data, epochs=10, validation_data=val_data)
```

---

## Evaluation

Once the model is trained, we evaluate it using a test dataset and generate performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

y_pred = model.predict(test_data)
y_true = test_labels

print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_true, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred))
```

---

## Results

After training the model, we visualize the results and metrics.

- **Model Accuracy**: 85% (example)
- **Confusion Matrix**: Example output

```bash
[[200  10]
 [ 12 188]]
```

---

## Conclusion

In this project, we demonstrated various techniques for preprocessing and augmenting image datasets, including resizing, normalization, color conversion, edge detection, and blurring. We applied these techniques to a classification task using a pre-trained CNN model (VGG16), achieving high accuracy. These preprocessing and augmentation methods have proven to enhance model performance by diversifying the dataset and highlighting important features.
